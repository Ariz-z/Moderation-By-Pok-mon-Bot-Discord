## Credits

Special Thanks to [Wiper-R](https://github.com/Wiper-R) for helping me in completion and active maintainence of the bot.

## Dependancies

This bot requires [Discord.py v1.7.3+ library](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) as a base dependency which can be installed using the pip package manager by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the base dependancies stored in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Hosting and Running the Bot

1. Edit the config.py file as per your requirement `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `OWNERS = []`, `DATABASE_URL = DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_NAME = DATABASE_NAME` 
Note:- The bot uses MongoDB as database.

2. Run bot.py to start the bot!

3. If you need further help then join the [Support Server](https://server.pokemonbot.com) for assistance.

## Note

The bot requires Server Members Intent , Server Presence Intent and Message Intent so make sure to enable that by going to your Discord Application -> Bot -> Privilaged Gateway Intents and enabling Server Members Intent. Without this, bot won't be able to access the cache to get user names.
